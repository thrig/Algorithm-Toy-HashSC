Algorithm::Toy::HashSC - toy separate chain hash implementation for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Algorithm::Toy::HashSC;
  my $h = Algorithm::Toy::HashSC->new;

  $h->put("key", "value");
  $h->get("key");           # "value"
  $h->put("blah", 42);
  $h->keys;                 # "key","blah" 
  $h->take("blah");         # 42
  $h->keys;                 # "key"

  # perhaps more interesting once more key/value pairs are added
  $h->keys_with("key")      # "key"

  # keys in a particular chain (from 0 to the modulus-1)
  $h->keys_in(0);

  # reset things
  $h->clear_hash;

  # change the number of chains (or buckets). this will destory
  # any prior contents of the hash
  $h->modulus(2);
  # or the modulus can be set via the constructor
  $h = Algorithm::Toy::HashSC->new( modulus => 2 );

  # Danger zone!
  $h->unsafe(1);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A toy separate chain hash implementation; productive uses are left as an
exercise to the reader. (Hint: music or artwork where the particulars of
the hash code and modulus thus groups the data; this ordering or
grouping can help determine e.g. pitch sets, rhythmic material, etc.
Hence, the B<keys_in> and B<keys_with> methods to obtain the keys in a
chain, or with a particular key. Variety could be added by varying the
modulus, or changing the B<hash> or B<hashcode> methods.)

This module is not for use where performance is a concern, or where
untrusted user input may be supplied for the key material. A
deterministic implementation such as this one may allow a malicious user
to cause all sorts of unwanted problems.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

The B<new> method accepts any of the L</"ATTRIBUTES">.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item B<_chain>

Where the keys and values are stored. Internal value. No peeking!

=item B<modulus> I<an-integer-greater-than-one>

Gets or sets the B<modulus> attribute. This determines the number of
chains available. It probably should be a prime number (and must be
greater than one) to better help evenly distribute the keys. A smaller
B<modulus> will cause longer chains, that is, more keys and values
lumped together.

Setting this value will clear the contents of the hash (by default).

=item B<unsafe> I<boolean>

If set to a true value, will allow unsafe operations. Possible side-
effects include old keys and values lingering in the hash (use
B<clear_hash> if this is a problem) or keys and values not being
available, or to allow duplicate keys to be stored (depending on the
particulars of B<modulus> and the result of the B<hash> calculation).

(A caller could pass keys with a B<hashcode> method that violates the
B<unsafe> setting, but that's their problem.)

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<clear_hash>

Clears the contents of the hash and returns the object.

The hash may also be cleared by default when various attributes
are altered.

=item B<get> I<key>

Obtains the value for the given I<key>. The key may be a scalar value,
or something that provides a B<hashcode> method. Equality is tested for
via the C<eq> operator (L<perlop/"Equality Operators">).

See also B<take>.

=item B<hash> I<key>

Used internally to calculate the index of the chain (or bucket) where
a given I<key> resides, within the limits of the B<modulus>
attribute. This calculation can be adjusted by supplying keys with a
B<hashcode> method.

=item B<keys>

Returns the keys present in the hash, if any. Keys are ordered based
on the structure of the hash chains, and this ordering will not
change unless the B<modulus> attribute or B<hash> or B<hashcode>
methods are altered.

=item B<keys_in> I<chain-number>

Returns the keys in the given I<chain-number> where I<chain-number> is
less than B<modulus>, if any.

=item B<keys_with> I<key>

Returns the keys in the same chain as the given key, if any. As with
B<keys>, this grouping will not change unless various attributes or
methods are altered. A smaller B<modulus> will cause more keys to
group together.

=item B<put> I<key> I<value>

Adds the given key and value to the hash. The I<key> may be an object
with a B<hashcode> method; this method should return a number that for
the expected set of key values results in evenly distributed numbers
across the given B<modulus>. If the key already exists in the hash, the
value will be updated.

=item B<take> I<key>

Deletes the given key/value pair from the hash, and returns the value. A
destructive version of B<get>.

=head1 BUGS

=head2 Reporting Bugs

Bugs, patches, and whatnot might best be applied towards:

L<https://github.com/thrig/Algorithm-Toy-HashSC>

=head2 Known Issues

The default hash code calculation has not been tested to determine how
evenly it spreads keys out across the modulus space. As a workaround,
the hash key can be an object that provides a B<hashcode> method, in
which case this issue falls out of scope of this module.

do not behave so simply as that of this module do.

as perfect as possible.
